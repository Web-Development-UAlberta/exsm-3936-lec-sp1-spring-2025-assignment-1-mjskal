# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
_This JavaScript II Assignment 1 demonstrates what I have learned about object-oriented programming: coding two classes, as per the diagram, that simulate a car and its engine. Both classes have their own constructors. The constructor of the car instantiates an engine for the car as an object. Properties of the car include make, model, year, odometer, and engine on/off status. The class for the car includes methods for start, stop, and drive. The overall goal of the project is to start the odometer at zero, start/stop/drive the car, and have the odometer log the correct mileage. I have also output a JSON string representing the new car object that has been instantiated._
